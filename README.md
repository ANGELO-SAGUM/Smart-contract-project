# Project Title

Auction Contract

## Description

This project provides an in-depth explanation of a simple auction contract, which facilitates a transparent and secure auction process. The contract allows users to place bids, and it keeps track of the highest bid and the corresponding bidder. The walkthrough video demonstrates how to use the contract, including placing bids, retrieving the highest bid, and handling multiple bids. This project is useful for anyone interested in learning about blockchain development, smart contracts, and their applications.
